This is the function you need to implement. Quick reference:
- input rows: 0 <= y < ny
- input columns: 0 <= x < nx
- element at row y and column x is stored in data[x + y*nx]
- correlation between rows i and row j has to be stored in result[i + j*ny]
- only parts with 0 <= j <= i < ny need to be filled
*/
